## Mapping the coupling between tract reachability and cortical geometry of the human brain

Our findings reveal that TGC is a robust measure, exhibiting heritability and predictive power over individual behavioral variation, with low-frequency eigenmodes offering enhanced explanatory potential. The quantitative assessment of the difference between high-/low-frequency TGC, i.e., high-low frequency ratio, highlighted a pronounced coupling between association tracts and high-frequency eigenmodes, with distinct patterns observed across various functional networks. Moreover, a significant correlation was identified between individual TGC profiles and brain activation maps. In conclusion, our TGC measure not only delineates the intricate relationship between cortical geometry and connectivity but also signifies a step forward in enhancing the accuracy of brain mapping techniques.
